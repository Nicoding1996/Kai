## The Vision

High-quality personal coaching is a powerful tool for growth, but it's often inaccessible due to cost, scheduling, and the simple difficulty of finding the right coach. Our team was inspired to solve this.** We wanted to use the power of modern AI to create a supportive, insightful coaching experience that was available to anyone, anytime.

## What it Does

**Kai** is a personal AI coach that provides a safe, non-judgmental space to explore your goals and challenges. Through natural, voice-driven conversation, Kai guides you using proven NLP frameworks to help you overcome limiting beliefs, clarify your objectives, and commit to actionable steps.
